## Let It Enfold You, by Charles Bukowski

Either peace or happiness,\
let it enfold you.

when I was a young man\
I felt these things were\
dumb, unsophisticated.\
I had bad blood, a twisted\
mind, a precarious\
upbringing.\
I was hard as granite, I\
leered at the\
sun.\
I trusted no man and\
especially no\
woman.\
\
I was living a hell in\
small rooms, I broke\
things, smashed things,\
walked through glass,\
cursed.\
I challenged everything,\
was continually being\
evicted, jailed, in and\
out of fights, in and out\
of my mind.\
women were something\
to screw and rail\
at, I had no male\
friends,\
\
I changed jobs and\
cities, I hated holidays,\
babies, history,\
newspapers, museums,\
grandmothers,\
marriage, movies,\
spiders, garbagemen,\
english accents, spain,\
france, italy, walnuts and\
the color\
orange.\
algebra angred me,\
opera sickened me,\
charlie chaplin was a\
fake\
and flowers were for\
pansies.\
\
peace and happiness to me\
were signs of\
inferiority,\
tenants of the weak\
and\
addled\
mind.\
\
but as I went on with\
my alley fights,\
my suicidal years,\
my passage through\
any number of\
women-it gradually\
began to occur to\
me\
that I wasn't different\
\
from the\
others, I was the same,\
\
they were all fulsome\
with hatred,\
glossed over with petty\
grievances,\
the men I fought in\
alleys had hearts of stone.\
everybody was nudging,\
inching, cheating for\
some insignificant\
advantage,\
the lie was the\
weapon and the\
plot was\
empty,\
darkness was the\
dictator.\
\
cautiously, I allowed\
myself to feel good\
at times.\
I found moments of\
peace in cheap\
rooms\
just staring at the\
knobs of some\
dresser\
or listening to the\
rain in the\
dark.\
the less I needed\
the better I\
felt.\
\
maybe the other life had worn me\
down.\
I no longer found\
glamour\
in topping somebody\
in conversation.\
or in mounting the\
body of some poor\
drunken female\
whose life had\
slipped away into\
sorrow.\
\
I could never accept\
life as it was,\
i could never gobble\
down all its\
poisons\
but there were parts,\
tenuous magic parts\
open for the\
asking.\
\
I re formulated\
I don't know when,\
date, time, all\
that\
but the change\
occurred.\
something in me\
relaxed, smoothed\
out.\
i no longer had to\
prove that I was a\
man,\
\
I didn't have to prove\
anything.\
\
I began to see things:\
coffee cups lined up\
behind a counter in a\
cafe.\
or a dog walking along\
a sidewalk.\
or the way the mouse\
on my dresser top\
stopped there\
with its body,\
its ears,\
its nose,\
it was fixed,\
a bit of life\
caught within itself\
and its eyes looked\
at me\
and they were\
beautiful.\
then- it was\
gone.\
\
I began to feel good,\
I began to feel good\
in the worst situations\
and there were plenty\
of those.\
like say, the boss\
behind his desk,\
he is going to have\
to fire me.\
\
I've missed too many\
days.\
he is dressed in a\
suit, necktie, glasses,\
he says, 'I am going\
to have to let you go'\
\
'it's all right' I tell\
him.\
\
He must do what he\
must do, he has a\
wife, a house, children,\
expenses, most probably\
a girlfriend.\
\
I am sorry for him\
he is caught.\
\
I walk onto the blazing\
sunshine.\
the whole day is\
mine\
temporarily,\
anyhow.\
\
(the whole world is at the\
throat of the world,\
everybody feels angry,\
short-changed, cheated,\
everybody is despondent,\
disillusioned)\
\
I welcomed shots of\
peace, tattered shards of\
happiness.\
\
I embraced that stuff\
like the hottest number,\
like high heels, breasts,\
singing,the\
works.\
\
(don't get me wrong,\
there is such a thing as cockeyed optimism\
that overlooks all\
basic problems just for\
the sake of\
itself-\
this is a shield and a\
sickness.)\
\
The knife got near my\
throat again,\
I almost turned on the\
gas\
again\
but when the good\
moments arrived\
again\
I didn't fight them off\
like an alley\
adversary.\
I let them take me,\
I luxuriated in them,\
I made them welcome\
home.\
I even looked into\
the mirror\
once having thought\
myself to be\
ugly,\
I now liked what\
I saw, almost\
handsome, yes,\
a bit ripped and\
ragged,\
scares, lumps,\
odd turns,\
but all in all,\
not too bad,\
almost handsome,\
better at least than\
some of those movie\
star faces\
like the cheeks of\
a baby's\
butt.\
\
and finally I discovered\
real feelings of\
others,\
unheralded,\
like lately,\
like this morning,\
as I was leaving,\
for the track,\
i saw my wife in bed,\
just the\
shape of\
her head there\
(not forgetting\
centuries of the living\
and the dead and\
the dying,\
the pyramids,\
Mozart dead\
but his music still\
there in the\
room, weeds growing,\
the earth turning,\
the tote board waiting for\
me)\
I saw the shape of my\
wife's head,\
she so still,\
I ached for her life,\
just being there\
under the\
covers.\
\
I kissed her in the\
forehead,\
got down the stairway,\
got outside,\
got into my marvelous\
car,\
fixed the seatbelt,\
backed out the\
drive.\
feeling warm to\
the fingertips,\
down to my\
foot on the gas\
pedal,\
I entered the world\
once\
more,\
drove down the\
hill\
past the houses\
full and empty\
of\
people,\
I saw the mailman,\
honked,\
he waved\
back\
at me.

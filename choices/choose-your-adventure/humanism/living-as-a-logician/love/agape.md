# 🥀 Agape תיקון עולם

#### **1 Corinthians 13**

**1**\
If I speak in the tongues of men or of angels, but do not have love,\
I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal.

**2**\
If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge,\
and if I have a faith that can move mountains,\
but do not have love, I am nothing.

**3**\
If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast,\
but do not have love, I gain nothing.

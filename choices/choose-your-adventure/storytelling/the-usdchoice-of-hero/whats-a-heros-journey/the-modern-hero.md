### _<mark style="color:purple;">"It's not society that is to guide and save the creative hero, but precisely the reverse. Every</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">player shares the supreme ordeal</mark> <mark style="color:purple;">- carries the cross of the redeemer - not in the bright moments of their tribe's great victories, but in the</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">silence of their personal despairs.</mark><mark style="color:purple;">"</mark>_

### <mark style="color:green;">- Joseph Campbell, on "The Hero with a Thousand Faces"</mark>



### _<mark style="color:purple;">"We are all living stones being built into a spiritual house. (...) The ‘ruins’ of past experiences, along with anguish, uncertainty, and restlessness, are interwoven with a faith that grows daily, takes shape through charity, and with a hope that does not disappoint."</mark>_

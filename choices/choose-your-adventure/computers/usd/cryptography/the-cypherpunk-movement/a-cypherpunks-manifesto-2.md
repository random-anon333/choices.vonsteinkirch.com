# 👾 The Duty of Builders

**We who design protocols are stewards, not gatekeepers.**\
**Our duty is not to build what is easiest, but what remains open and self-sovereign.**

**When complexity tempts us to centralize, we must remember: every line of convenience code can become a choke point.**\
**When critics ask why our designs are complicated, we should ask them what — or whom — they are trusting instead.**\
**If simplicity comes from trust, it is not simplicity. It is surrender.**

**Trustlessness costs computation, latency, and mental effort.**\
**It buys resilience, longevity, neutrality, and freedom.**

**Trustlessness also requires viable incentives.**\
**Systems must reward those who sustain them without turning them into gatekeepers.**\
**A protocol that relies on unpaid altruism will decay.**\
**A protocol that rewards control will centralize.**\
**The only stable equilibrium is one where neutrality is profitable.**

***

**We choose to build trustless systems even when it is harder.**\
**We pay the cost of openness over the convenience of control.**\
**We do not outsource neutrality to anyone who can be bribed, coerced, or shut down.**\
**We measure success not by transactions per second, but by trust reduced per transaction.**

**We refuse to build on infrastructure we cannot replace.**\
**We refuse to call a system "permissionless" when only the privileged can participate.**\
**We refuse to trade autonomy for polish, or freedom for frictionless UX.**\
**Trustlessness is not preserved by consensus alone - it is preserved by resistance.**

**If your protocol requires faith in an intermediary, change it.**\
**If it relies on a private gateway, replace it.**\
**If it hides critical state or logic off-chain, expose it.**

**In the end, the world does not need more efficient middlemen.**\
**It needs fewer reasons to trust them.**
